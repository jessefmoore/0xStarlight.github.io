•	Based off the MITRE ATT&CK framework

•	Able to attack Web and Network devices.

•	Able to attack from inside and outside environment

•	Infrastructure for pentesting

•	Metasploit Pro (inside/outside Azure) for Web App/ Network Exploitation.

•	Kali (inside/outside Azure)

•	Empire (PowerShell Post Exploitation)

•	Ngrok

•	ProxyChains

•	WPScan (WordPress Vuln Scanner)

•	Nikto (Web App Vuln scanner)

•	Responder (Windows Hash harvesting)

•	HaveIBeenPwned API to check Password reuse.

•	Scripts to perform parts of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

•	Pentesting Lab with VMware Workstation to create replicate Org Environment to perform testing, Join random computer to domain.

•	Test exploits on Operating systems

•	Test Evasion methods on Anti-Virus

•	Test MITRE ATT&CK approach

•	Test automation

•	Pentest standards: http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page




**Assumptions**
