Pentesting Project Considerations
 

Requirements

Utilized this approach: MITRE Framework for Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and common knowledge (ATT&CK).
Persistence, PrivEsc, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Execution, Collection, Ex-filtration, Command and Control.
Reporting design to train/help Blue Teams.
Based off the MITRE ATT&CK framework
Able to attack Web and Network devices.
Able to attack from inside and outside environment
Infrastructure for pentesting
Metasploit Pro (inside/outside Azure) for Web App/ Network Exploitation.
Kali (inside/outside Azure)
Empire (PowerShell Post Exploitation)
WPScan (WordPress Vuln Scanner)
Nikto (Web App Vuln scanner)
Responder (Windows Hash harvesting)
John (password cracking)
Hydra (password guessing/BruteForce)
Cobalt Strike (Commercial product)
Custom Widows box for exploitation
PowerSpoit
PSHunt
PSATTACK
BloodHound
https://www.slideshare.net/RusselVanTuyl/powershell-for-cyber-warriors-bsides-knoxville-2016
Custom Mac box for OSX exploitation
Rainbow tables -Password Cracking/Guessing
Spear Phishing (Metasploit Pro)
Burp Suite Pro (inside/outside Web Application)
WiFi Pinapple
Physical access will be in-scope such as getting into Data Centers or work-spaces (cubicles, etc) in NJB, IBM, UWMC, etc.
Team Foundations for (exploit) code repository (free up to 5 people and hosted on o365)
HaveIBeenPwned API to check Password reuse.
Scripts to perform parts of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
Pentesting Lab with VMware Workstation to create replicate UW Environment to perform testing.
Test exploits on Operating systems
Test Evasion methods on Anti-Virus
Test MITRE ATT&CK approach
Test automation
Test scale
Use Unfetter https://iadgov.github.io/unfetter/ -Unfetter Discover is focused on helping the user analyze security gaps in their environments, explore the threats, and experiment with the next steps. Unfetter Discover maps mitigations and security controls to MITRE's ATT&CKâ„¢ framework and demonstrates how to explore risks based on attacker behaviors.
Pentest standards: http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page
Purchase exploits: http://exploithub.com/
Exploit Creation - Reverse engineering and software development (shellcode, buffer overflow-Memory curruption) for Windows and Linux.
File share to hold all exploits from Github
Wiki to hold process/procedures (Confluence)
Simulate insider threat
 

Pre-REQs

Training (lots, Network, Web app, and other TTPs) SpectorOps, SANS, BCSecurity Empire, eLearning, pentesteracademy, CQURE, PenTest magazine, etc

Web Application training via book: The Hacker Playbook 2: Practical Guide To Penetration Testing

Experience in Red Team/Pentesting activities. (CCDC, http://www.nationalccdc.org/, etc)

Certifications (GPEN, GWAPT, OSCP)

Programming (Software Engineering) experience or training.

 

Assumptions

Written permission from CISO/Department/Organization to perform pentest.

Appropriate Rules of Engagement and Scoping performed before Pentesting/Red Team Ops.

 

Pentest/Red team Ops plan

Asset Inventory either in IP Addresses or more broadly the domains.

Feed results into Risk Team

Feed results into DFIR/Detection Teams with IoC identified and added to Mandiant IOCe

Management of reporting/measurements of results

Primary Prioritized required by Risk teams recommendations

Secondary prioritization required by management needs

All new systems/application going through projects (IRB, Project Intake, Acquisitions of new org aquisitions, affiliations, etc) will be required to have a line item (budgeted) to require application/system/technology gets pentested externally.
